### Q1 Performance
- CloudSync Pro: 15% growth, exceeded target
- DataVault: 3 new enterprise clients (Goldman, Mayo Clinic, Pfizer)
- Revenue: $12.3M (target: $11M) ✅

### MobileGuard Launch
Jennifer raised concerns about the October timeline:
> "The iOS 18 changes are more significant than anticipated. We may need to push to November to ensure quality."

David's response:
> "Quality is non-negotiable. If we need November, take November. But I want weekly status updates from Sarah Chen."

**Decision**: Tentative launch date moved to November 15, 2024. Will reassess in July.

### CloudSync Pricing
Lisa proposed tiered pricing restructure:
- Current: $15/user/month flat
- Proposed: $12 (Basic), $18 (Pro), $25 (Enterprise)

Michael's concern:
> "Engineering effort for feature gating is ~6 weeks. Do we have runway?"

**Decision**: Pricing change approved for Q4. Engineering to prioritize after MobileGuard beta.
